**Philosophers - A Threaded Exploration 🤔🍝**

Welcome to the Philosophers project, where you'll delve into the world of multithreading and mutexes. In this intriguing endeavor, you'll be tasked with simulating a group of philosophers who alternately eat, think, and sleep while seated around a round table. Your challenge? To ensure the philosophers dine without starving and to gracefully handle the complexities of concurrent processes. 🪴🍽️

**Project Overview 🌐**

Philosophers, in this context, are not pondering profound questions but rather partaking in a unique dining experience. The setup involves philosophers sitting at a round table, with a large bowl of spaghetti placed in the center. Each philosopher has a designated seat and a pair of forks, one on each side, for dining convenience. Their actions include eating, thinking, and sleeping, and they must coordinate the use of forks to avoid conflicts. 🤔🍝💤

**Key Features 🛠️**

∙ Simulating philosophers as threads. 👩‍🔬👨‍🔬

∙ Managing forks and meal times using mutexes. 🔒⏱️

∙ Ensuring philosophers dine without starving or encountering concurrency issues. 🍴🍀

**In Conclusion 📜**

The Philosophers project introduces you to the fascinating world of multithreading and synchronization using mutexes. It's a unique opportunity to explore concurrent programming and ensure that your philosophers enjoy their meals without any unintended mishaps. Bon appétit! 🍽️🔄💬
